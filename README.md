## Deliverables
Based on the information provided, the following is requested:

- Definition of the Acceptance Criteria for that User Story
- Writing Gherkin BDD test cases to validate that User Story
- Taking into account that this User Story has web implementation for backend and frontend, comment on what tools you would use to manually validate this User Story on each side.
- As a QA Analyst within a team, describe the ceremonies and meetings you think that need to occur during the sprint.
- As a last step, we would like to incorporate validation of this new use case into our regression testing plan.
    - What tools would you use to automate the web, iOS, Android and backend parts?
    - What CI/CD tools do you think could be used to schedule the execution of the regression tests in a planned and manual way?
- Imagine that our PO tells us on Thursday morning that there is a new User Story that has to be included in this sprint that closes on Friday at noon and that you still have 1 development of an User Story to receive from the developers and test it. What alternatives would you propose?
